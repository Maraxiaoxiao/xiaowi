            <p>They say Kids Life is Happy. No Stress, No Problems Just Hungry. That's why even is this Kidszone game, I wanted to feel like a kid so If I am sad I just go get some food and sleep. Sleep without crying.</p>

            <h3>YUMMMM YUMMMM</h3>
            <p>If other people's stress reliever is music, for me Ã©ating' is the best. I am always full. Cry then eat. Sad then eat. Eating can make you chubby but Eating can make you feel better.</p>
